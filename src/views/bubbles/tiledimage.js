/**
 * This module provides access to subsections of a multi-resolution tiled image
 * at a desired resolution.
 *
 * Here's a quick overview of what I've determined about the structure of the
 * images.
 *
 * Images a are represented in increasing resolution levels from 0 upwards.
 * The dimensions of an image at a given resolution level are given by:
 * 2^l where l is the level. Therefore:
 *
 * level 0: 1x1
 * level 1: 2*2
 * level 2: 4*4
 * ...
 * level 8: 256*256
 * level 13: 8192x8192
 *
 * The resampled image at each level is split into square tiles, say 256x256.
 * So level 13 would be represented as a 32x32 grid of 256x256 tiles.
 *
 * An image can take up less space than the available area in a given level.
 * Perhaps because it has a non-square aspect ratio, or because the source image
 * does not have a dimension which is a power of 2. In this case, tiles without
 * image content can be ignored.
 *
 * Rows and columns of tiles in a resolution level are counted from 0, where 0,0
 * is the top-left tile.
 *
 *
 * Our encoder places images at the top-left of the available area of a
 * resolution level, so tiles at the right and bottom edges may be unused.
 * It appears to encode/tile the source images by determining the highest
 * resolution level required to fit the source image without resampling, and
 * then work down from there. The resolution level needed for an image of a
 * given width and height is given by ceil(log2(max(width, height))).
 *
 * The dimensions of a level below the full resolution level can be calculated
 * by: w * 2**(t-f)  where w is the width or height, t is the target level and f
 * is the full-resolution level.
 *
 * For example, say we have an image 7880px wide and high.
 * The max level = 13 = math.ceil(math.log2(7800))
 * The size at level 8 = 243.75 = 7800 * 2^(8-13)
 *
 * Note that our encoder rounds up the scaled dimension, so level 8 would be
 * 244*244 here.
 *
 * --------------
 * For our bubble similarity viewer I need to load tiles to show randomly chosen
 * subsections of images in the circular bubbles. I could load the dzi XML for
 * each image, which contains the exact dimensions of the image at the highest
 * resolution available. That would mean lots of requests. Instead, because I
 * know that our images all fit into level 13 at max res, they'll all fit into
 * a single 256x256 tile at level 8. As such, I can fetch the level8 tile for
 * each image and:
 *   a) use it as a preview of the full res image
 *   b) use the dimensions of the image to calculate upper and lower bounds on
 *      the dimensions of the full resolution (level 13) image.
